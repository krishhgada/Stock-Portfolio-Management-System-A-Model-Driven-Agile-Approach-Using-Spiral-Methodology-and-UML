# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Portfolio Management System (SPMS)
*A Model-Driven Agile Approach Using Spiral Methodology and UML*

## Overview  
This project presents a **model-driven design** for a Stock Portfolio Management System (SPMS) that integrates the **Spiral Development Model** with **Agile Scrum** principles. It focuses on **risk-aware planning, iterative refinement, and user-centric architecture**.  

While the system has not been implemented, it provides a **complete set of UML diagrams**â€”including **Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, and State diagrams**â€”to serve as a **blueprint for future development** in FinTech solutions.

## Methodology  

### **1. Spiral Model**
- Iterative cycles for **risk analysis, planning, and evaluation**  
- Allows **incremental refinement** of requirements and architecture  
- Ideal for **complex financial systems** with evolving user needs  

### **2. Agile Scrum**
- **Time-boxed sprints** for structuring design tasks  
- **Sprint reviews** and retrospectives for continuous improvement  
- Agile workflow applied to **system modeling and documentation**  

This hybrid approach combines **strategic planning** with **agile adaptability**, resulting in a **flexible yet structured design process**.

## ðŸ“‚ UML Modeling & Design Artifacts  

| Diagram            | Purpose                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Case Diagram**  | Captures user interactions and system boundaries  |
| **Class Diagram**     | Defines core entities and relationships           |
| **Sequence Diagram**  | Illustrates time-ordered system interactions      |
| **Activity Diagram**  | Models workflows and decision points              |
| **State Diagram**     | Shows system state transitions for dynamic events |

Each diagram ensures **traceability from requirements to design**.

## Functional Requirements  

- **User Authentication** â€“ Secure login & registration  
- **Portfolio Management** â€“ Add, remove, modify assets  
- **Real-Time Market Data** â€“ Access live financial information  
- **Personalized Insights** â€“ Risk-based investment recommendations  

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Performance:** Fast real-time updates  
- **Security:** Strong authentication & data protection  
- **Usability:** Simple, intuitive UI for all user levels  
- **Reliability:** High availability & fault tolerance  

---

## Comparative Analysis  

Existing platforms like **Zerodha, Groww, and Yahoo Finance** primarily focus on **data aggregation** with minimal **personalization** or **behavioral finance integration**.  

Our **SPMS** design introduces:
- **Risk-profile-based insights**  
- **Transparent architecture documentation**  
- **Agile and model-driven system design** for future scalability  

---

## Future Work  

- Integration with **real-world APIs** (e.g., Alpha Vantage, NSE APIs)  
- **Machine learning models** for predictive insights  
- **End-to-end implementation** with full-stack technologies  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** with real investors
